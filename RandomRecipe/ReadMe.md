This project is ongoing.

It's meant to scrape your Google Keep for your favorite recipes and output a set as a menu for planning.

It will categorize by Vegan/Non-vegan/Seafood meals.

It currently just scrapes a formatted text file with the recipes.  I need to figure out how to scrape the JSON in C++ from Google Keep,
and also write a script that downloads the appropriate JSON.

C++ was probably not the best choice for this app, but I wanted to work on some C++.
